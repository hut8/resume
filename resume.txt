INTERESTS..:Fiss: Simple, fast HTTP server for serving static files from the local filesystem.
 +   FOSS...Written in Go. Provides integrated SSH tunneling so that someone behind a very

            sandhog: dead-simple forward and reverse SSH tunnels on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X. Go.

            tumblr-go: Go bindings for the Tumblr API. Responses are native Go structs where possible.
